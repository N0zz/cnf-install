# cnf-install

## Installation

### Dependencies

`cnf-install` major dependencies are `bash` and `which`.

Minor dependencies (`curl`, `xmllint`, `grep`, `awk`, `sort`, `basename`, `echo`) are handled by `cnf-install`, which provides installation instructions if you're missing them.

### Install

```bash
CNF_RELEASE="v0.3-alfa"
wget https://github.com/N0zz/cnf-install/releases/download/${CNF_RELEASE}/cnf-install -O /usr/bin/cnf-install
chmod +x /usr/bin/cnf-install
unset CNF_RELEASE
```

## Usage

### Standard usage

```bash
Usage: cnf-install ${COMMAND} [-f -p]
  -f / --force - force command-not-found.com query to show installation methods even if package is already installed
  -p / --package_only - show package names only in output - useful for automation
```
