# cnf-install

## Installation

### Dependencies

`cnf-install` major dependencies are `bash` and `which`.

Minor dependencies (`curl`, `xmllint`, `grep`, `awk`, `sort`, `basename`, `echo`, `column`) are handled by `cnf-install`, which provides installation instructions if you're missing them.

### Install

```bash
wget https://github.com/N0zz/cnf-install/releases/download/v0.1/cnf-install -O /usr/bin/cnf-install
chmod +x /usr/bin/cnf-install
```

## Usage

### Standard usage

```bash
Usage: cnf-install ${COMMAND} [-h -f -p -v]
  -h / --help            - prints help/usage
  -f / --force           - force command-not-found.com query to show installation methods even if package is already installed
  -p / --package_only    - show package names only in output - useful for automation
  -v / --version         - prints cnf-install version
